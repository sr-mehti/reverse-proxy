🔐 High-Performance HTTPS Reverse Proxy via Cloudflare

This project provides a scalable and secure Node.js-based HTTPS reverse proxy designed to forward HTTPS traffic to a target server protected by Cloudflare proxy.
It supports full request forwarding, including headers and body, making it ideal for accessing APIs or services behind Cloudflare with minimal latency and maximum reliability.
✅ Features

    📦 Built with Express.js & Axios

    🔁 Full method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

    ⚡ High concurrency via keep-alive HTTPS Agent

    🌐 Transparent header forwarding

    🛡️ SSL certificate support (Let's Encrypt / self-signed / Cloudflare Origin Certificates)

    📈 Ready for production scaling with load balancers

🛠 Use Case Example

Imagine your backend API is deployed behind Cloudflare with proxy and SSL enabled. This reverse proxy allows a different public HTTPS server to forward secure traffic to your Cloudflare-protected origin.

This is especially useful for:

    API aggregation & routing

    Frontend ↔ Backend traffic mediation

    Cloudflare-based DDoS protection front

    Bypassing IP restrictions safely
